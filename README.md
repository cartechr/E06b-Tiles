I was able to a game using the text map editor and your main1.py
1)My game one objective: Get the platform in the the top right corner
2)The kinda used the coins images as obstacles as well
3)Not all of the objects seen in my game are obstacles (coins).
4)This game will take skill and being able to remember what works and what doesn't.
